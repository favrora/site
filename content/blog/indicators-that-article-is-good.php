    <p>Before publishing, the text still needs to be edited. It is easier to notice mistakes if you distract from the text for at least a day. But to eliminate roughness, check the text for different types of errors, and only one type at a time. And preliminarily put on the mask of the reader - the average representative of the audience. Constantly think about how to interest him. And follow these six steps in order.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Check your balance</h2>

    <p>Are the introduction, body and conclusion balanced? Usually, the introduction and conclusion occupy no more than 10% of the post, and 90% will remain for the main part.</p>

    <p>Do all thoughts in the main body have equal weight? Our example is five things for a healthy lifestyle. So describe food, exercise, sleep, work, and rest in equal detail. If the importance of sleep has been confirmed by scientific research, find similar evidence for the rest of the elements of a healthy lifestyle.</p>


    <h2>Step 2: Check the paragraphs</h2>

    <p>Every time you see a new idea, make a new paragraph. Examples and stories can be in the same paragraphs or new. If you find the paragraph is too long, divide it by two or three. Vary the length of paragraphs to avoid visual and semantic monotony.</p>


    <h2>Step 3: Check the tone</h2>

    <p>Is the selected tone suitable for the theme? And for the audience? For a blog style? For example, you write about nutrition:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Nuts are a source of healthy fats. They contain minerals that are essential for the functioning of the body. At the same time, they are more pleasant to eat than nutritional supplements. It makes sense to love nuts, right?</li>
      <li>The last sentence is the tone indicator. Change it depending on the audience. If you are writing for professionals over 40, but choose a professional and caring tone, the proposal will sound ridiculous. In this case, correct the tone or delete the sentence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The tone will help you connect with your audience. You can write:</p>

    <p>If you are not already eating nuts, add them to your diet. It sounds difficult, but it is not. To constantly eat nuts, it is enough to add them to the shopping list. Then you will not forget to buy them and start adding to dishes and eating a few pieces every day for a snack. It's that simple!</p>

    <p>Here, the tone helps to clarify the topic from the first sentence. It is a friendly tone that the author uses to show that he understands the reader's problems and knows how to help. Readers will immediately feel connected to the author and will want to know more.</p>

    <p>Re-read and think about the tone: tone it down or increase it, depending on what the audience wants.</p>


    <h2>Step 4. Read the post aloud</h2>

    <p>Read the post aloud slowly, clearly, and as loudly as possible. Mark what sounds wrong. When you finish reading, correct everything you noted.</p>


    <h2>Step 5: Relax</h2>

    <p>You have done a great job, time to rest. Please take a break from the text for at least a day. Forget about fasting and don't read, even for fun.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Check the GPS</h2>

    <p>Use GPS to make sure you are heading in the right direction. Since the letters G, P, and S mean different things, do this step three times - once for G, one for P, and finally third for S.</p>

    <h3>G - grammar</h3>

    <p>Here are the pieces of grammar to check:

    <p>Are the sentences grammatically correct? Maybe you changed the sentence "Dr. Petrov speaks" to "American Medical Council experts ..." but forgot to change the word "speaks" to "speak."</p>

    <p>Are the parts of the sentence in place? When you talk about sleep: "In Paris at midnight he was already asleep." The sentence is out of order. It will be more understandable: "At midnight in Paris, he was already asleep."</p>

    <p>Are the times agreed? "Many people think they are not getting enough sleep and will decide to sleep more." Oh! The present has turned into the future, the proposal sounds strange. Here's the correct answer: "Many people think they don't get enough sleep and decide to sleep more."</p>

    <p>Prepositions in the right place? Prepositions describe the relationship of a noun with another word in a sentence. “Eat at the table” means eating while sitting at the table. “Eat on the table” sounds like nonsense. If you make a mistake in the preposition, the meaning will be lost.</p>

    <p>Using too many adjectives? Adjectives describe nouns: “Rejuvenating, restorative, immune-strengthening qualities of restful sleep ...” Adjectives like makeup. If used in moderation, it is beneficial. Overdo it and get the opposite effect.</p>

    <p>If there are many adjectives in the text, then the author was too lazy. Learn to convey thoughts without relying on adjectives.</p>

    <p>Using too many adverbs? Adverbs describe the verbs: "Eating quickly is harmful for several reasons." Adverbs are also indicative of laziness. Try to find the exact verbs instead: "Swallowing food is harmful for several reasons."</p>

    <p>Check the use of words. The phrase sounds normal when it is spoken in live speech: "Jumping off a cliff on a rope may not be a recreation option for everyone." But when writing, change the text to simple and understandable: "Jumping from a cliff with an elastic band is not a recreation option for everyone."</p>

    <p>Watch out for the words-parasites: "very", "real", "well", "so" and others. It is “very important” that you “really really love”, but it will make it difficult for the reader to understand the idea. These words are used so often that they have almost lost their meaning. Everyone has favorite words and phrases. Do you start a lot of sentences with "well"? Do you often use the words "only" and "even"? If you remove them, the post will benefit from this.</p>

    <h3>P - punctuation</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Does each sentence end with a period, question, or exclamation mark?</li>
      <li>Does every sentence begin with a capital letter?</li>
      <li>Are the quotation marks placed correctly?</li>
      <li>Is there a single space between words and after each punctuation mark everywhere?</li>
      <li>Should you replace the comma with a dash or colon?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>S - spelling</h3>

    <p>Automatic check will not help if you want to say about "lead poisoning", but write about "cotton poisoning". Check the spelling yourself. And make sure to spell the names of the people and titles correctly.</p>

    <p>You're done editing the post! GPS brought you to the end of your trip. But before you go off the road, see if you've done these three things:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Have you read the plan?</li>
      <li>Keeping the audience in mind, focusing on what interests them?</li>
      <li>Did you follow these six steps in turn, checking only one thing at a time?</li>
      <li>If not, please go back and do it. You are close to the finish line - what to write the best post. It will be a shame to fail because of mistakes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After that, it remains only to click "Publish". Do it calmly. You gave this post everything you could. And it will return you a thousand times more when readers see it as a benefit and remember you as a good author.</p>
