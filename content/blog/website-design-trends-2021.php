    <h2>Simplicity and convenience</h2>

    <p>“Less is more” is a permanent trend. Simplicity means a neat page with a light background in the best traditions of minimalism. Space is god: when used correctly, you can get a multi-functional design.</p>


    <h2>More design with augmented reality</h2>

    <p>The rapid rise in popularity of augmented reality, or AR, will not only be seen in the games, video and app industries. AR has a good chance of reaching the design field, especially due to the popularity of mobile devices. DIA Studios, which apply 3D typography to everyday objects, could be a likely inspiration.</p>


    <h2>More creative photography</h2>

    <p>Modern photo shoots and branding campaigns will become more daring and experimental with clever design techniques. Created on the basis of paper sketches or 3D visualization, such a design will definitely stand out and remain in memory.</p>


    <h2>Animation, Gift-pictures and cinemagraphics</h2>

    <p>Websites, logos, promotional videos of goods and services - traffic graphics are used everywhere. One of the leading trends in motion graphics is subtle transitions that help the consumer better understand the product. Motion graphics are present in typography too, from eye-catching titles on sliders to animation on a logo.</p>

    <p>In 2020, a return to cinemographic trends is very likely (these are static pictures with single moving elements, for example, an image of a cup from which steam rises with animation). Significant elements should not be stationary!</p>


    <h2>A set of colors and patterns from the 80s-90s</h2>

    <p>Where did we see this? Well, of course: this is the return of the colors popular in the 80s and 90s with their acid pink and daring contrast. Is this nostalgic mood a returning trend? Or is it all explained by the fact that young designers are people whose childhood was spent surrounded by crazy colors of those years?</p>

    <p>Their old toys and their parents' dubious outfits from the point of view of today's fashion served as an inspiration for the revival of a bright, colorful trend, complemented by a number of modern trends.</p>


    <h2>Combination of 2D and 3D</h2>

    <p>It has become very fashionable to create 3D objects and place them in 2D projects. This combination gives a unique external aesthetic, combining depth and flatness. The technique can be applied in many different directions of design, from creating logos to websites and promotional videos. The end result is a complex visual presentation that is impossible to forget.</p>


    <h2>Layout with broken "grid"</h2>

    <p>Some designers feel that traditional "grid" layouts limit their creativity, so they seek to change the rules and unleash their creative energy. A "grid" with overlapping pictures and text on top of each other can create a unique experimental design.</p>


    <h2>Rounded corners and flowing shapes</h2>

    <p>Over the past years, the design has been dominated by right angles and pointed geometric shapes. In recent months, smooth lines and rounded shapes have displaced them. Combined with rich colors and layering, this trend is gaining ground.</p>


    <h2>Backgrounds with moving elements</h2>

    <p>"Make me read" is a hidden appeal of the user to any web designer. Backdrops with moving elements solve this problem, drawing the eye, but not distracting attention from the text. In addition, they do not cause any loading problems, unlike video backgrounds.</p>

    <p>Subtle movement of the texture, light animation, the effect of floating bubbles - all of them will perfectly fit into the web site design, the purpose of which is to please the user. Even in 2021.</p>


    <h2>Gradients 2.0</h2>

    <p>Ultra-minimalism has dominated web design for a long time. In an effort to simplify and reduce everything visually as much as possible, the designers "cut out" all unnecessary, leaving only the most necessary.</p>

    <p>Thanks to this, all interfaces and products are similar, without coloring and with a lot of white space. But in 2018, everyone got bored of it, and gradients came to replace minimalism, which became very popular. By adding depth to layouts, they make them juicier and more attractive, and also allow for the use of the brand's signature colors.</p>

    <p>In 2021, gradients have moved to a whole new level. They can be either subtle, using muted colors, or bright, juicy. The main feature of the new gradients is simplicity and the use of one or at most two shades.</p>


    <h2>Abstract illustration</h2>

    <p>Over the past year, we have seen a real explosion of various illustrations, in 2020 they will take center stage in web design trends. All large companies that follow design trends have already switched to using illustrations on their websites and social networks. Such images are immediately remembered and become the hallmark of a brand or a specific product. They cannot be copied - each illustration is unique, unlike the color scheme or the font used.</p>


    <h2>Bold fonts</h2>

    <p>When visiting the website of any modern company that is moving in design trends, the first thing you will notice is the page title. Of course, large headings at the beginning of a site's page are not new, but the trend is towards heavier and larger fonts. In 2020, the trend is headings in heavy bold fonts, which give the captions more visual meaning and direct the reader to themselves first. This design approach gives websites a modern aesthetic look.</p>

    <p>Large, heavy fonts are great for creating contrast and visual hierarchy of elements in graphic design. This improves the readability and understanding of the text and the message contained in it.</p>

    <p>But when using such a font, it is important not to overuse it, otherwise the design will be overloaded and incomprehensible to the end user.</p>

    <p>Here are some tips for using bold fonts in your design:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A large amount of text in large bold type can scare away those who decide to read it. Use this typeface in short headlines or individual pieces of text.</li>
      <li>It is better to use such text on a contrasting background, it should be clearly visible and readable, then it will definitely fulfill the functions assigned to it.</li>
      <li>Better to use simple sans-serif fonts that scale easily without sacrificing readability.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Emotional design</h2>

    <p>Today, the focus of design is shifting towards the emotional impact on the consumer. Companies are moving away from design neutral to design that has a definite emotional impact. It turned out that it is not at all difficult to evoke certain emotions in a person by designing a website or packaging. And as tests have shown, this has a positive effect on consumers and product sales in general.</p>

    <p>There are already many examples from popular designers of the use of emotional design. To do this, they use static images or funny animations that interact with the visitor on the site.</p>


    <h2>Background video</h2>

    <p>In recent years, there has been a real boom in the development of video content on the Internet. Everyone loves watching videos, not reading text. It is quick, convenient and requires absolutely no effort. Therefore, this trend has migrated to web design. And this year it will be relevant: everyone is tired of static backgrounds on websites, everyone wants movement and dynamics. Through video, designers can create certain emotions comparable to watching a real movie.</p>


    <h2>Outcome</h2>

    <p>You've probably already heard about some of the trends presented in this article, and some will be new. But do not rush to immediately implement all these trends in your design.</p>

    <p>Regardless of trends and trends in web design, it is important to remember that the main goal of any graphic design is to help users quickly navigate the product and convey meaning and feelings. Usability and fashion need to be able to combine, otherwise the design will be fashionable and modern, but it will not fulfill its primary mission. Weigh all trends well, and only use those that help users by enhancing their user experience.</p>
