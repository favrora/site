    <p>What is website redesign? When do you need a website redesign? How much does a website redesign cost? We answer these and other questions in our article.</p>

    <h2>What is website redesign?</h2>

    <p><strong>Website redesign</strong> is a complete redesign of the site (improvement, addition), i.e. not only a change in its design, but also the entire software component.</p>

    <p>Some clients mistakenly think that a redesign is just a design change. An unrelated service, for the performance of which it is enough to order a website design, after which the new design is easily integrated into the current website. This is not true. The result of the site design development service is the receipt of graphic layouts of the future site and its individual pages. And this is just the beginning.</p>

    <p>The process of changing the site design is directly related to the software component of the site. To implement a new design, additional work is required - layout and programming of the site, for example, using the WordPress system. Also, it is important to keep all the current information on the site and the structure of the sections.</p>

    <p>That is, website redesign is not just design development, but complex work: design, layout, programming, content, website testing, SEO optimization.</p>

    <h3>The main reasons when you need a website redesign</h3>

    <p>Most often, a <b>website redesign</b> is ordered when a site reconstruction (site modernization) is required and the main reason is to improve the existing site structure and update the design.</p>

    <p>Redesign is carried out if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The design is outdated (it was developed several years ago, it looks unpresentable - it scares away customers);</li>
      <li>There is no adaptability for mobile devices (it is inconvenient to use the site from mobile devices, the design does not scale for different screen sizes);</li>
      <li>There are new requirements for the structure of the site and for its functionality;</li>
      <li>The site was created on the constructor and it is impossible to introduce your own design or add new functions (you need to create a site on a well-known control system).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Everybody needs a website redesign periodically. For example, if a company changes its corporate identity or makes a rebranding, then the logical continuation of the changes will be a complete redesign of the site.</p>

    <p>In case of a decrease in traffic to the site (which inevitably leads to a decrease in orders), you should also think about a full or partial redesign. In order to improve the usability of the site or its visual appeal.</p>

    <h3>How much does a website redesign cost?</h3>

    <p>There is a short answer to this question - a website redesign costs the same as it costs to create a website.</p>

    <p>The <b>cost of website redesign</b> depends on many factors and is estimated on an individual basis. All sites are different, with different functionalities, and each customer has their own requirements for the site and these requirements must be understood before it will be possible to make an assessment.</p>

    <img src="/src/img/blog/website-redesign-services/2.png" alt="Website redesign cost" class="w-400">

    <p>If your site is running on a little-known management system (CMS) or a self-written system (written from scratch and the developer does not want to deal with it anymore), or perhaps access to the site is basically lost, the process of integrating a new design into the site becomes even more complicated.</p>

    <h2>What information is needed to evaluate a redesign?</h2>

    <p>So that we can estimate the cost of a website redesign, we need:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Get a link to your current site to assess its current state and see what information is on the site, what is its volume;</li>
      <li>Understand which management system (CMS) it runs on. If the system is not known, we will offer to change it. Most often, customers themselves want to change it.</li>
      <li>It is also important to understand whether it is required to save all the current functionality on the site, perhaps something will be removed from being unnecessary or something needs to be added (affects the amount of programming work);</li>
      <li>whether all information on the site will be saved (all pages, menus, text information) or global changes are planned.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Having received this information, the contractor can already calculate the cost and offer options.</p>

    <p>Write to us and indicate your requirements, we will contact you and announce the cost of the work.</p>
