    <p>Internal factors of site optimization undoubtedly affect the position of the site in the search results - this is the proposed axiom of the optimizer, which does not require proof. That's just, it's worth figuring out what exactly they affect, the ranking of the site, the relevance and indexing of the site's pages, or maybe this is just an invention of "rabid optimizers".</p>


    <h2>What are the internal factors of website optimization?</h2>

    <p>According to the theory, the internal factors of site optimization are the rules according to which the site should be built, its pages should be written and designed in order to "like" the search engines. The word like is a bit vulgar, let's replace it with so that the search engine processes will allow them to consider that the information on your site is more suitable for the user at his request, and the site was raised in the search results.</p>


    <h2>Internal optimization factors or which site do search engines "like"</h2>

    <p>To make your site stand out from the crowd of other resources when crawled by search engines, you need to follow fairly simple rules, which are called internal optimization factors. Let's combine the internal factors into several groups and, unlike external optimization factors, relate only to the content of the site itself:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Text content of pages</li>
      <li>Graphics of the content</li>
      <li>General structure of the site</li>
      <li>Site navigation</li>
      <li>Internal linking of the site</li>
      <li>Meta content tags</li>
      <li>Keywords from the semantic core</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In general terms, we describe each group of internal optimization factors.</p>


    <h2>Text content of pages</h2>

    <p>The textual content of the pages is very important in site optimization. And the main thing here is the uniqueness of the content of the articles. Fortunately, uniqueness algorithms do not yet have a logical perception of texts, and therefore cannot assess the uniqueness of stylistics. In assessing the uniqueness, it is estimated that the text, as current, is not in the Internet.</p>

    <p>Uniqueness is assessed as a percentage. Excellent is 100% uniqueness. Good uniqueness at least 96%. The best option for the textual content of the article, which has a positive effect on the issue of the article, is a self-written article with 100% uniqueness on which the user will linger for more than 5-10 seconds.</p>


    <h2>Content graphics</h2>

    <p>Content graphics are nothing more than photographs and drawings of articles and the site as a whole. With indexing and website promotion by photo, the situation is not very simple. Not about her yet. To improve the internal factors of photo optimization, they should at least be compressed as much as possible. At least two photos of the article must contain the "alt" tag, with the keywords of this article.</p>


    <h2>General site structure</h2>

    <p>The site structure should be tree-like. There should be a main page that gets indexed first of all. Site articles should be divided into sections and subsections. For young sites, do not make the depth of subsections longer than two, but rather one subsection for a section.</p>

    <p>Speaking about the general structure of the site, you need to remember the semantic core of the site, which you should have assembled in advance.</p>

    <p>It is unlikely that the following site structure can be called classic, but it is definitely possible to be successful:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The main page is optimized for 1 RF request and 2 MF requests.<li>
      <li>Site sections include articles optimized for LF requests, which are extended HF and MF requests for the main page and section titles.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Conclusion on internal ranking factors</h2>

    <p>From the point of view of a search engine, the ideal (?) Site for ranking should:</p>

    <ul style="list-style: none">
      <li>1. Have absolutely unique content. The content must expand (at least 400 words or 200 characters) the answer to the query entered by the user into the search string.</li>
      <li>2. Have a large but natural number of links in which your site is recommended;</li>
      <li>3. Have cited external links to significant and authoritative resources;</li>
      <li>4. Do not have external links to resources, questionable content;</li>
      <li>5. The site should be constantly, 1-2 times a week for a new site and once a month, updated with new content;</li>
      <li>6. And, unfortunately, search engines take domains seriously from 6 months of age.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It should be noted that different search engines take into account internal optimization factors in different ways. So Google, very much "loves" external citations and a large number of external "bold" links. Yandex love such love, it can evaluate as link spam and impose a filter for it.</p>
