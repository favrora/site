    <p>The Internet appeared about 50 years ago, but it managed to become a public resource relatively recently. And what's more, it happened so quickly that now many netizens can't imagine their lives without it.</p>

    <p>With the advent of the Internet, much has changed-in the world and separately in the life of society, each of its representatives.</p>

    <p>New technologies are being developed, programs are being created that save human labor, and the search for information is becoming easier every day. New professions are emerging. For example, one of them is an Internet marketer.</p>

    <p>There are many specialists on the market who call themselves Internet marketers. It is interesting that the basics of this profession are not taught at the university. Maximum-courses or self-study.</p>

    <p>Just as previously everyone connected with computers was called "computer scientists", equating system administrators, programmers, and technical support specialists into one category, today everyone who pushes something somewhere on the Internet is called Internet marketers.</p>

    <p>If you plan to hire an intelligent Internet marketer in your company, then you need to understand what to demand from him, what requests to set and how to solve problems with his hands.</p>

    <p>In this case, you need to focus on an elementary understanding of the marketing skills of an Internet marketer.</p>

    <p>In fact, the job of an Internet marketer (an Internet marketing specialist, an Internet marketing manager) is to increase sales and profit growth through working with the value of a product or service using Internet tools. And in order for an employee to perform tasks effectively in their place, they need to have certain skills and competencies.</p>

    <p>In the same article, we have described for you the most necessary skills of a real Internet marketer, each of which will work for the result. In the complex — for profit.</p>


    <h2>1. Analytics</h2>

    <p>An analytical mindset is a must-have skill for an Internet marketer. This person thinks with facts, theses and can find a way out of any incomprehensible situation.</p>

    <p>An Internet marketer in a company, regardless of its niche:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>analyzes the main metrics of the company's sales, advertising campaigns, and Internet platforms;</li>
      <li>analyzes and manages the priorities of activities and work in Internet channels;</li>
      <li>manages the marketing budget, clearly calculates the ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment);</li>
      <li>manages the testing and implementation of hypotheses based on causal relationships in consumer behavior.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>2. Professionalism</h2>

    <p>This item separately requires consistency and rhythm: knowledge in Internet marketing becomes obsolete at a rate of 3-9 month. Therefore, an Internet marketer must constantly improve their competence regarding:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>methods of attraction on the Internet, working in Internet channels,</li>
      <li>techniques and methods of sales using the Internet,</li>
      <li>current trends in consumer behavior on the Internet, content consumption on the Internet,</li>
      <li>new methods of web development.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>3. Communication skills</h2>

    <p>An Internet marketer is a manager or specialist who often sets tasks and accepts the results of their work. In more than 80% of cases, it is more effective to do this in writing, rather than verbally. And then the following comes out. The Internet marketer owns:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>competent written speech, informative presentation style</li>
      <li>oral presentation skills,</li>
      <li>knowledge of English can be an advantage,</li>
      <li>the ability to quickly find a common language with different team members.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>4. Proactivity</h2>

    <img src="/src/img/blog/skills-for-an-internet-marketer/2.jpg" alt="7 Skills Every Internet Marketer Should Have" class="w-400">

    <p>The Internet marketer himself forms and sets himself tasks based on the current actual needs of the company. He is a strategist, and the result of his work depends on him.</p>

    <p>If the promotion on the Internet does not bring you profit, then something is wrong with your specialist. His eyes should light up every time he talks about contextual advertising. And his work should be visible on the company's financial statements — and not in the negative, but only in the positive. This specialist should be energetic and active — and both qualities should be directed to the effectiveness of promotion on the Internet.</p>


    <h2>5. Responsibility</h2>

    <p>The Internet marketer manages the marketing budget, influences the ROMI indicator, so a good Internet marketer in the company takes responsibility for fulfilling obligations, makes vital decisions for the company.</p>

    <p>As a rule, part of his salary is directly linked to the indicators of the created benefit for the business. And he gets a percentage of every effective campaign he has implemented on the Internet.</p>


    <h2>6. Focus on results</h2>

    <p>An Internet marketer is a specialist or manager who performs tasks on time. His remuneration is directly linked to the result created for the business (see point 6). And the result is his main goal and task in the work.</p>

    <p>There is no point in doing the work just for show, all the actions of an Internet marketer should lead to the overall goal of the company.</p>

    <p>In order for your Internet marketer to see the result and go to it, set goals for him. For a month, for six months, for a year or more. It would be nice if the goal was a kind of challenge for the specialist. In this way, you not only increase the efficiency of the company, but also develop the Internet marketer-in his skills, efficiency in completing tasks and his own satisfaction with the completed plan.</p>


    <h2>7. Flexibility in completing tasks</h2>

    <p>Internet technologies are developing every second, and to achieve record-breaking marketing indicators in business, it is necessary to use new and relevant Internet channels, methods, and platforms. Therefore, it is important for an Internet marketer to be open to new technologies and views. A conservative is not suitable for this job.</p>

    <p>Your Internet marketer should think with possibilities. Every time you get acquainted with a new technology, he is in a hurry to implement it in the work of the company and is ready to explain to you — clearly and clearly — his choice.</p>

    <p>If necessary, it quickly switches to new methods of work, if existing solutions have not led to the desired results. He is ready to look for ways out of any situation to the point of completion of the search, which is equal to the success of the company. He perceives any unsuccessful experience as an experience that he learns from and shares with colleagues and young specialists.</p>
