    <h2>1.Phil Barden “Hacking Marketing. The Science of Why We Buy"</h2>

    <p>In 2002, the Nobel Prize in economics was given to psychologist Daniel Kahneman. He explained how, from a psychological point of view, people make economic decisions - for example, to buy.</p>

    <p>Phil Barden, marketer for Unilever, Diageo and T-Mobile, collected Kahneman's ideas and explained with specific examples what happens in the mind of the buyer when he makes decisions. What exactly influences him in the selection process, how is it easier for him to part with money.</p>

    <p>You can probably also say that this is the shortest, most capacious and digestible book on marketing. Vital for marketers and entrepreneurs.</p>

    <p>Quotes from the book Hacking Marketing. The Science of Why We Buy":</p>

    <p>The neuroscience of purchasing decisions is based on a simple equation: net worth = pleasure - pain. The higher the net value, the more likely the purchase is.</p>

    <p>Autopilot responds faster to a warning that if you don't take any action, you will lose money than an offer to get something.</p>

    <p>Brands are the framing of a product. They subtly influence its perception and value through the framing effect.</p>

    <p>There are two types of costs: financial and behavioral. The latter includes the amount of time and effort required to get pleasure.</p>

    <p>We have no absolute idea of the value of an object, service or experience, even if we are perfectly informed. All we can do is compare similar things. I compare my lunch to other lunches, not cars, trips, or trips to the laundry.</p>

    <p>In marketing communications, it is most effective to use a moderate amount of novelty combined with persistence of meaning.</p>


    <h2>2. Seth Godin “Purple Cow. Make your business stand out! "</h2>

    <p>Most of the book is about the fact that traditional advertising does not work and we no longer notice it. Seth argues that selling at a time when people are ad blind is to stand out from the crowd. It is necessary to create unique products so that customers come for them themselves.</p>

    <p>The purple cow is not just a satisfying product, it is something extraordinary.</p>

    <p>According to Godin, the main task of marketing is not to describe, but to invent a product. It is important to come up with a clear and digestible idea that distinguishes the product from the rest. The next step is to constantly analyze and adjust the product in order to provide customers with effective solutions to problems.</p>

    <p>It is important to be attentive to customers, look for your own strategy, differ from industry leaders (if they are far ahead) and competitors in general.</p>

    <p>And yet, an interesting thought: take risks, not follow the leaders. Focus on clients who can tell others about you - innovators and early adopters. They are excited about new products and can usually talk loudly about them. These are the ones who are usually called trendsetters.</p>

    <p>Quotes from the book “Purple Cow. Make your business stand out!":</p>

    <p>That's what the right marketing is. Marketing, where the seller changes the product, not the advertisement.</p>

    <p>Most people cannot buy your product. They have no money, or time, or desire for this.</p>

    <p>Don't be boring! Safe means risky! Today it all depends on the design! Very good is bad!</p>

    <p>It is much easier to sell what people want to buy.</p>

    <p>Of course, it is better to do something outstanding than to do nothing. Conversely, it’s better not to do anything than to do marketing just to do something and “splurge”.</p>

    <p>Low price is the way of the lazy, it is the last resort of a product developer who has no more interesting ideas left. Cheap is not the way for the Purple Cow. Those who fail in the end are those whose designs are never criticized.</p>



    <h2>3. Paul Brown, Carl Sewell "Customers for Life"</h2>

    <p>Carl Sewell is the owner of a large car dealer network, in business since the 60s, for a very long time and very successfully. According to him, the strategy of a business that is tuned in for a long game in the market is, first of all, friendship with existing customers, customer retention. Attraction for a one-time purchase is just an introduction to the brand. It is important for the seller to establish a connection with the customer from the first purchase.</p>

    <p>They copied an informative snippet about the book from the blog of its publishing house Mann, Ivanov and Ferber: “Karl's customer satisfaction rates are very high. His business often tops the ratings of the most customer-centric. Karl recommends betting on loyal customers, as the disposition for one-off sales makes customers unstable. The simplest rule of customer retention is: "Do what you promised and do it the first time."</p>

    <p>Quotes from the book "Clients for Life":</p>

    <p>The world's best customer service system is also the simplest: DO WHAT YOU PROMISED AND DO IT FIRST TIME.</p>

    <p>Treating people kindly is only 20% of good service. The more important part is developing technologies and systems that get the job done well the first time. No amount of smiles will help you if your customer is not happy with your product or service.</p>

    <p>So, if a client asks if you can do something for him, the answer is always "yes" - provided that the request is somehow related to your business.</p>

    <p>Do not charge money for such additional services, which are help. If you didn’t ask a friend to pay for such help, don’t ask the client either. Don't worry, you will earn more in the future than you can imagine.</p>

    <p>If you want your employees to be polite and nice to clients, be polite to them.</p>
