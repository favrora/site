    <p>In this article, we will explore the differences between rebranding and redesign.</p>

    <h2>So what is rebranding?</h2>

    <p><strong>Rebranding</strong> is a change in the concept of a brand. This is an active marketing strategy, and it carries the risk of losing your old audience. Therefore, rebranding is done only when you cannot do without it. For example, if the audience has lost interest in a product, the brand has become irrelevant, or competitors have a clear advantage, the company's management decides that it is time to change something.</p>

    <p><b>Rebranding</b> can include changes in workflows and communication with customers, changing the price segment, expanding the audience, changing the brand name and creating a new visual image.</p>

    <h2>And then what about the redesign?</h2>

    <p>This is just a design change. Most often, this is called a logo update - because it is the most important part of a company's design: it is from the logos that we primarily recognize brands. But also a redesign can be called, for example, a change in the site or the design of outlets.</p>

    <p>Sometimes they also use the term "restyling" - a large-scale redesign, which concerns not only a logo or a website, but all visual communications. We can say that this is a change in the corporate identity of the company.</p>

    <p>Usually a redesign or restyling is part of the rebranding. If a company is making any deep changes, it will most likely change something in the <strong>design</strong> - to reinforce its new concept.</p>

    <h2>And the fact that the packaging of goods periodically changes - is this also a redesign?</h2>

    <p>Yes, it's a packaging redesign. It is made even if the old design looks quite modern - just for a change. The consumer gets used to the type of goods on the shelves and chooses purchases out of habit. A new wrapper, box or can helps to catch the eye, attract attention, and stand out from competitors. So brands often redesign their packaging without changing either the logo or corporate colors.</p>

    <h2>Goals and objectives of the redesign</h2>

    <p>Modernization of the style and functionality of the site is carried out in order to make it easier for users to work with the resource, add additional features and functions that were not provided for by the previous design. At the moment, the function "Reviews from social networks", "Calculator", the implementation of which has become possible thanks to web developments in recent years, is in great demand. Online stores and selling sites have been armed with new feedback options via Viber or WhatsApp with a direct transition from the site.</p>

    <h3>Is there a redesign without rebranding?</h3>

    <p>Of course. This happens if there is no need to radically change the brand, but its visual is outdated. The redesign is done in order to show the consumer a new, fresh and relevant picture, but at the same time to maintain recognition.</p>

    <h3>When else do they do redesign and rebranding?</h3>

    <p>Logo redesigns are usually done precisely because graphic techniques are aging. On average, they try to create logos for at least five years, although some remain relevant for decades. But if the company lives for a really long time, the logo will have to be updated sooner or later.</p>

    <p>Packaging design can be changed for several reasons. Not always to draw attention to the product on the shelf - sometimes companies want to make the packaging more convenient for the customer, cheaper to manufacture, or better suited to transport.</p>

    <p>Website and app <b>redesign</b> is carried out in different situations. For example, to improve the user experience, to reduce the cost of site maintenance, or when buyers have new opportunities online.</p>

    <p>There are even more reasons for rebranding:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Structural changes in the company.</li>
      <li>Changing the scope of the company, entering other markets.</li>
      <li>Changing values, brand character.</li>
      <li>Changing target audience.</li>
      <li>Significant change in the competitive environment.</li>
      <li>Change of the brand in the brand portfolio of the company.</li>
      <li>The need to distance ourselves from the previous negative experience of interaction of the brand with consumers .â€”- To radically change the range of goods or services;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Goals and objectives of rebranding</h2>

    <p>Depending on the scale and stage of development of the company, industry, market conditions, as well as many other factors, the goals of rebranding can be completely different.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Increase in sales and profits;</li>
      <li>Achieving brand uniqueness;</li>
      <li>Strengthening positions in the market;</li>
      <li>Adaptation to new conditions to which the brand cannot adapt in its current form;</li>
      <li>Preparation for upcoming external challenges;</li>
      <li>Increasing brand awareness, popularity and loyalty;</li>
      <li>Disconnection from competitors;</li>
      <li>Formation of a positive image of the company.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Based on the goals of rebranding, the corresponding tasks are formed. They can be:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Coverage of new consumer segments;</li>
      <li>Attraction of new clients;</li>
      <li>Formation of a new positioning of the company in the market;</li>
      <li>Increasing the level of competitiveness;</li>
      <li>Achievement of recognizability of products and their quick identification; by the consumer at the points of sale;</li>
      <li>Attracting attention from old clients;</li>
      <li>Refreshing the perception of the brand by the target audience</li>
      <li>Updating the product matrix in accordance with current market trends and trends.</li>
    </ul>
