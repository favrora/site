    <h2>Preliminary preparation</h2>

    <p>Content strategy is a description of the path to the goal, implementation is the path itself. This is a routine daily work, without which a bright future cannot be achieved. The content strategy spelled out which channels are the most optimal for promotion, what style of publications ("brand voice") should be, how to blog correctly, what should be the newsletter about, what should be done to optimize texts on the site, etc.</p>

    <p>But this is not enough to bring it to life - there is not enough detailed elaboration. Therefore, you need to do tactical planning - to paint step by step what to do and how. You need to start with the main thing - setting goals. Yes, it's trite and sore, but what to do is the basis, step zero, so please.</p>


    <h3>1. Set a goal</h3>

    <p>Tactical actions are needed for each point of the strategy. And for each action, you need to define your goal and markers by which it will be clear that the result has been achieved. The goal should be specific and measurable, and the wording should be as clear as possible.</p>

    <p>Not "increase traffic", but "increase traffic to 700 unique visitors per day, the number of subscribers up to 3000 in 6 months, the number of clients up to 50 per month." When you know exactly what to expect from your content strategy, it will be easier for you to track, analyze, and adjust the results.</p>


    <h3>2. Face reality</h3>

    <p>Estimate your budget. Can you do everything the content strategy recommends at the same time? If not, then you need to first prioritize - determine what is most important to you. Social networks? Newsletter? Website? Arrange promotion channels in order of decreasing importance to you.</p>


    <h3>3. Talk to the staff</h3>

    <p>There will be many more people implementing the content strategy than were originally drawn up. And it is important that every person who will create, publish or distribute content knows and understands the main goal. Your task is to tell employees about the strategy, convey its importance and give access to all the necessary documents: editorial policy, content plan, analytics.</p>

    <p>When people feel like they are part of a team, see the results of their work, it is highly motivating. And if employees do not understand your global idea and have no idea whether their work is profitable, it is sad, they are unlikely to work effectively.</p>


    <h3>4. Choose a reporting system</h3>

    <p>It can be Excel, a Google document, special software - choose what is convenient for you and your employees. Of course, employees must be able to work with reports in the selected program)</p>


    <h3>5. Select a monitoring system</h3>

    <p>Determine in which system you will track the data (Google Analytics, Mediator, IO technologies, etc.) and decide how often you will do it:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Daily. It makes sense if you're running social media, running an ad campaign, or testing a new format. With daily monitoring, you will quickly spot shortcomings and be able to make changes.</li>
      <li>Weekly. It is sometimes useful to track growth dynamics over a short period of time. If you have a small blog or are just starting, then weekly monitoring is not very important.</li>
      <li>Every month. This indicator needs to be monitored in any company - in a month you can already see the disadvantages or advantages, which content "shot", which "did not enter", which channel shows excellent results and which does not. Traffic metrics will show if you are heading in the right direction, user behavior metrics - if your site and content are doing well.</li>
      <li>Every quarter / year. These indicators well reflect the dynamics of development, they show how well the strategy was implemented, whether it meets the business goals of the company and whether it needs to be refined. Analyze the data and do not be afraid to make changes to the work - the commander must be flexible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Every quarter / year. These indicators well reflect the dynamics of development, they show how well the strategy was implemented, whether it meets the business goals of the company and whether it needs to be refined. Analyze the data and do not be afraid to make changes to the work - the commander must be flexible.</p>


    <h3>6. Identify key metrics</h3>

    <p>Key indicators for each business are different - for some, visits are significant, for others - subscriptions, for others - reposts. Think carefully and decide which data is important to you and which is not very important. </p>

    <p>Keep in mind that there are vanity metrics that are self-indulgent but don't provide any important information about meeting your business goals. This is usually notorious traffic - what good is a lot of traffic if it doesn't bring in customers?</p>

    <p>The number of customers is actually also an indicator of vanity - this metric should be used only in conjunction with other data: what is the average bill a customer has, his “lifetime” in the company, what is the cost of his attraction and return.</p>

    <p>Preliminary preparation is over, it is already clear where we are going and what tools we will use. Now we draw up a tactical plan for the strategy. Open the document and add an action plan for each item indicating the person in charge and the date of execution.</p>

    <p>So that is all. Now it remains to give the task to all responsible and monitor the execution. But you don't need to think that this is where your work is over. On the contrary, everything is just beginning) But this is a completely different story - about how to analyze the effectiveness of a content strategy.</p>
