    <h2>SEO promotion</h2>

    <p>Search engine optimization is considered the most effective way in the long term development of the project. When pages are displayed in the TOP of search engines, the resource receives a constant stream of traffic, brand awareness increases, and sales grow.</p>

    <p>The essence of SEO is the comprehensive development of a web project and the promotion of pages for key queries in search engines.</p>

    <h2>Contextual advertising</h2>

    <p>Contextual ads are displayed in the ad units of the search page and are determined by the subject of the search query. Contextual advertising allows you to quickly get traffic, which is why it is often used immediately after launching a project on the network.</p>

    <p>Of the advantages of context, it is worth highlighting:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Quick start of an advertising campaign.</li>
      <li>Accurate hit and wide coverage of the target audience.</li>
      <li>Flexible pricing: per 1000 impressions, per clicks or actions.</li>
      <li>Ability to customize the target and measure performance through analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Among the shortcomings, it is worth noting:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Limited use - contextual ads are ineffective for promoting unpopular or highly specialized topics.</li>
      <li>Short-term effect - traffic and sales disappear immediately after the advertising campaign is turned off.</li>
      <li>Difficulty to set up and competition - In popular market niches, it is difficult to get results due to high competition. Requires budget and specialist involvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Typically, contextual ads are used to promote commercial-type sites in Yandex and Google: landing pages and online stores, for which, according to the owners, there is no point or time to focus on SEO.</p>

    <h2>Social media promotion</h2>

    <p>SMM or promotion using social networks allows you to form a subscription base and increase traffic to the website being promoted. The main advantages of SMM: direct contact and receiving feedback from the target audience, as well as the ability to achieve results even with a limited budget.</p>

    <p>The most popular methods of promotion using SMM: targeting and advertising in groups or communities. Let's consider both options in more detail.</p>


    <h2>Targeted advertising</h2>

    <p>Targeting promotion involves showing ads to a given audience, which can be segmented by the following parameters:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Geolocation or residence.</li>
      <li>Age and gender, marital status.</li>
      <li>Profession or education.</li>
      <li>Income level.</li>
      <li>User interests.
    </ul>

    <p>The available parameters for the target are directly determined by the volume of the database that a blog or social network collects about its users. The ability to customize the target, for example, for Vkontakte and Instagram will be different.</p>

    <p>In fact, social targeting. networks is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly launch sales at the start of the project and get stable traffic to the promoted site after the formation of a subscription base and brand reputation.</p>


    <h2>Advertising in groups and communities</h2>

    <p>Buying ads from bloggers, thematic communities and publics is a quick way to attract large amounts of traffic. When choosing this method of promotion, you need to determine the "opinion leader" - a media person or a public, reflecting the interests of their subscribers, which are as similar as possible to the portrait of your target audience. The cost, as well as the effectiveness of promotion, directly depend on the activity and reputation of the "opinion leader", as well as the volume of the subscription base.</p>


    <h2>Display advertising</h2>

    <p>The essence of display advertising is the spectacular perception or interactive interaction of the user with commercial information. The types and technologies of website promotion using display advertising are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Graphics, banners - static or animated graphics with advertising material. The most popular formats are banners, streamers or imitations.</li>
      <li>Videos - most often, commercials are launched on video hosting sites like YouTube, less often on regular sites.</li>
      <li>Audio - advertising tracks broadcast on specialized portals: music platforms, online radio, etc.</li>
      <li>Branding - website design in the corporate style of the advertised brand. The background and background change, sometimes the cursor and navigation of the website.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Display advertising allows you to increase your brand's visibility on the Internet. This promotion method is aimed at working with a cold audience and is necessary for generating demand, even suitable for selling narrow-profile goods. The main thing is to choose the right site and be creative in the development of advertising material.</p>


    <h2>Advertising on external resources</h2>

    <p>This method involves posting news, informational articles and press releases in online media or thematic authoritative publications. The main task is to provide an informational reason for mentioning the promoted brand or its products among the target audience of the media or other portal.</p>

    <p>Benefits:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Wide coverage and broadcasting to target audience.</li>
      <li>Increase the visibility of the site on the Internet.</li>
      <li>Formation of a positive reputation about the brand.</li>
      <li>Increase the link profile when placing an active link in the text.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is only one lack of advertising on external resources - huge requirements are imposed on the quality of published materials. The higher the authority of the portal providing the hosting service, the more practical value the published content should have.</p>


    <h3>What method of website promotion should you choose?</h3>

    <p>We have listed the most common methods of website promotion and customer acquisition on the Internet. Briefly summarizing, we can say that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>SEO-promotion is the basis for business development on the Internet. Search engine optimization is essential for the successful development of projects aimed at the long term.</li>
      <li>PPC advertising is a fast way to get traffic and sales. The effectiveness of the RC depends on the specifics of the business and the budget of the company.</li>
      <li>Promotion in social networks is a method suitable both for quickly attracting an audience for a young project, and for building a subscription base as a constant source of traffic.</li>
      <li>Display advertising - allows you to create demand for a product and effectively work with a cold audience. The effectiveness of display advertising is determined by the popularity of the site and the creativity in the approach to creating advertising materials.</li>
      <li>Advertising on external resources is a good way to make yourself known using any news feed.

    </ul>
